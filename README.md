# BlackJack
A blackjack game made in Python with a simple graphical user interface.

This is a simple blackjack game that I created in order to learn the fundamentals of Python in conjuction with graphical user interfaces.
**Simple** code logic is used and the GUI is simple (no animations are implemented here, just internet-search based images of cards.)

You can check out and play and save the game [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user47_DAYBmsgQBE_2.py)
